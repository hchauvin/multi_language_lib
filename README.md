This project showcases how reusable C++ code can be shared between R, Python, and Julia, the three
main statistical/machine learning languages. It showcases how package management could be done
using conan, a C++ package manager, and the language-specific package managers.

Alternative to Conan: conda, for cpp, julia, and whatever, but is it something that is used
a lot by the R users? Also, CRAN, Conan and Conda compatibility layer?
